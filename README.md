## Installation

1. Backup your existing nvim config (if any):

   ```

   git clone git@github.com:yfozekosh/lzvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. Start Neovim:

   ```bash

   Lazy.nvim will automatically install all plugins on first launch.

## Description

This is a personalized Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), a modern Neovim starter template. It is tailored for .NET development, with plugins and settings optimized for C# and related workflows. It uses lazy.nvim as the plugin manager and includes custom configurations for an enhanced development experience.
